description: "<p>The alt provides fallback (alternate) text to display when the image specified by the <img> element is not loaded.</p>\r\n<p>This may be the case because of an error, because the user has disabled the loading of images, or because the image hasn't finished loading yet.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most important reason to use the alt property is to support <strong>accessibility</strong>, as the alt text may be used by screen readers and other assistive technologies to help differently-abled users make full use of your content. It will be read aloud or sent to the touch device, for example, to support visually impaired users.</p>\r\n<p><em>(taken from the Mozilla MDN site)</em></p>"
